Piping
  Pipes are a good way to format strings, currency amounts, dates and other display data. Angular ships with several built-in pipes and you can create your own.
  <h2>{{hero.name | uppercase}} Details</h2>

[(ngModel)] is Angular's two-way data binding syntax.
  it binds the hero.name property to the HTML textbox so that data can flow in both directions: from the hero.name property to the textbox, and from the textbox back to the hero.name

[class.selected]="hero === selectedHero"
  When the current row hero is the same as the selectedHero, Angular adds the selected CSS class. When the two heroes are different, Angular removes the class.

Services are a great way to share information among classes that don't know each other. You'll create a MessageService and inject it in two places
